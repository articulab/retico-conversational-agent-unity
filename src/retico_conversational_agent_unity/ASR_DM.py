"""
Whisper ASR Module
==================

A retico module that provides Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using a
OpenAI's Whisper model. Periodically predicts a new text hypothesis from
the input incremental speech and predicts a final hypothesis when it is
the user end of turn.

The received VADTurnAudioIU are stored in a buffer from which a
prediction is made periodically, the words that were not present in the
previous hypothesis are ADDED, in contrary, the words that were present,
but aren't anymore are REVOKED. It recognize the user's EOT information
when COMMIT VADTurnAudioIUs are received, a final prediciton is then
made and the corresponding IUs are COMMITED.

The faster_whisper library is used to speed up the whisper inference.
